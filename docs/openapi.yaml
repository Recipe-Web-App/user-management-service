  title: User Management Service API
  description: |
    A comprehensive user management microservice providing authentication, profile management,
    social features, notifications, and administrative capabilities for a recipe web application.

    ## Features
    - User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
    - Profile management with privacy controls
    - Social features (following/followers)
    - Notification system with preferences
    - Administrative tools and metrics
    - Health monitoring endpoints

    ## Authentication

    This service uses **OAuth2 authentication** provided by an external OAuth2 service:

    - **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** for web/mobile applications
    - **Client Credentials Flow** for service-to-service communication
    - **Scope-based authorization** with granular permissions
    - **Token introspection** and validation handled externally

    Include tokens in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    **Note**: User registration, login, and password reset are handled by the external OAuth2 service, not by this API.

    ## Available OAuth2 Scopes
    - `openid` - Basic user identification (required)
    - `profile` - User profile information
    - `user:read` - Read user data and profiles
    - `user:write` - Create and update user data
    - `admin` - Administrative operations
  version: 1.0.0
